If you’re a web developer, you may be considering a switch from Java to Kotlin. Kotlin is probably best well-known as the language for Android development—it’s concise, flexible, and includes a powerful set of modern language features—but it’s also a great choice for JVM-based web development. In this course, Nate Ebel guides you through the transition from Java to Kotlin for server application development. He starts by exploring Kotlin’s place in the JVM ecosystem, then shows you how to migrate an existing Java-based Spring Boot application to Kotlin. He also shows you how to build a new application using Ktor, a Kotlin-based client/server framework. If you’ve wondered what Kotlin’s features can do for your JVM web development, join Nate in this course.
